Here’s a **one-page cheat grid** for Python, mapped to **Aristotle’s Four Causes**. You can keep this next to you while coding/debugging.

# 🐍 Python × Four Causes Cheat Grid

### **Material Cause (Matter) → the stuff**

* Literal values: `1`, `3.14`, `"hello"`, `True`, `None`
* Elements inside containers: `42` in `[42, 43]`
* Function arguments at call time: `5` in `sqrt(5)`
* Return values: `10` in `return 10`

---

### **Formal Cause (Form) → the shape**

* Data structures: `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`
* Types/classes: `int`, `float`, `str`, `MyClass`
* Variable as a *slot* (not the content): `a` in `a = 1`
* Function signatures: `(x, y)` in `def add(x, y)`
* Sorting/order constraints: `sorted(list)` ensures form

---

### **Efficient Cause (Agent) → the doer / operation**

* Function definitions (tools that act):

  ```python
  def f(x): return x*2
  ```
* Function calls: `int(a)`, `sum(lst)`
* Operators: `+`, `*`, `==`, `<`
* Control flow: `for`, `while`, `if`
* Methods: `.append()`, `.pop()`
* Builtins that act: `print()`, `exit()`

---

### **Final Cause (Purpose) → the goal / why**

* The **return value** of a function:

  ```python
  def total(nums): return sum(nums)  # Purpose: total
  ```
* The side effect: printing, writing to a file, updating a DB
* The overall program’s objective:

  * CLI tool: “display results”
  * Script: “transform input → output”
  * Library: “provide reusable functions”

# 📝 Quick Debug Questions

* Am I treating a **Form** (container/type) as if it were **Matter** (value)?
  → e.g. looping over `[ [1,2], [3,4] ]` but assuming `1,2,3,4`.

* Am I applying an **Agent** (operation) to the wrong level of **Form**?
  → e.g. `s += v` where `v` is a list instead of a number.

* Does my `return` reflect the **Final Cause** I intend?
  → e.g. returning a list (Form) when the goal was a total (Matter).

✨ With this grid:

* **Matter = content**
* **Form = structure/type**
* **Agent = operation**
* **Purpose = goal/output**
